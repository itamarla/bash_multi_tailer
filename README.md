# bash_multi_tailer
A small bash script to tail directories with multiple files, even before those exist

It's a fun script that makes bash do crazy things like threads and traps.

How can one enjoy it?
well, if you don't have something like xtail and you want to monitor a log directory and tail it's files content. you can start the script with the directory's location as parameter (The directory needs not exist in the time of execution) and any new file that sprouts in it will be tailed to screen.

You can also add a prefix of the file name. this way only files with a specific prefix would be tailed.

Enjoy!
